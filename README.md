# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a guide I created to help me stay organized for School. Taking a new course can be stressful, I wanted to have my important notes all in one place to make studying easier and more efficient. I learned a lot with this project. I'm totally new to coding, so this was a lot of fun to do. The main topics practiced in this project were:

- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- JavaScript

This Project was extremely useful to me, I hope someone else can benefit from this project as well!

## Usage

The Prework Study guide is organized by topics to allow for organized note taking and studying. Topics included thus far are HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Along with these useful notes, if you open the DevTools console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), you can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics I learned from my prework and will choose a topic to study first.
