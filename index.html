            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It gives the content style.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS. Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They're useful for quick and permanent changes. Each Inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li>Internal Style Sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and ID's, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to ALL tagged page elements.</li>
            <li>External Style Sheets are the most common. It allows you to keep all the CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <li>When using an External Style Sheet, you use the link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
            <li>Separation of Concerns: is a widely used term. It refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: The CSS Property we want to apply and the Value of the property.</li>
            <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, the elements borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS Box Model.</li>
            <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
            <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the locstion (URL) of the externsl resource.</li>
            <li>Class Attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
            <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. we can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
